# Getting Started with React

To become proficient with React and build efficient web applications, it's important to understand the following concepts and techniques:

## 1. Introduction to React
- **Overview**: Understand what React is and why it's popular for building user interfaces.
- **Installation and Setup**: Guide to setting up a React development environment and configuring a new project.

## 2. Components
- **Component Basics**: Learn about components and how they help build user interfaces.
- **Function Components**: How to create and use function components.
- **Class Components**: How to create and use class components.
- **Props and State**: Using props to pass data to components and state to manage internal component data.

## 3. Props
- **Understanding Props**: Learn how to use props to pass data between components.
- **Prop Types Checking**: Using PropTypes to check the type of props passed to components.

## 4. State
- **Understanding State**: Manage the internal state of a component.
- **Using `useState` Hook**: Manage state in function components with the `useState` hook.

## 5. Event Handling
- **Handling Events**: Add and handle events such as click, submit, and input in React.
- **Events in JSX**: Writing event handlers in JSX and managing event behavior.

## 6. Hooks
- **Introduction to Hooks**: Understand the concept and benefits of hooks in React.
- **`useState` Hook**: Manage component state in function components.
- **`useEffect` Hook**: Manage side effects and perform tasks like data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulation. Understand how to use `useEffect` for executing code after the component renders and cleaning up resources.
- **`useContext` Hook**: Share data between components without prop drilling using Context. Learn how to create and use a Context to manage and access global data across the component tree.
- **`useReducer` Hook**: Manage complex state logic in a component using a reducer function. Understand how to use `useReducer` for scenarios where state transitions are more complex.
- **`useMemo` Hook**: Optimize performance by memoizing expensive computations. Learn how to use `useMemo` to avoid recalculating values unnecessarily during re-renders.
- **`useCallback` Hook**: Memorize callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components. Understand how `useCallback` can help in optimizing performance by maintaining stable function references.

## 7. Routing
- **React Router**: Install and use React Router for managing navigation in your React application.

## 8. Data Management
- **Advanced State Management**: Introduction to libraries like Redux or Zustand for global state management.
- **Youtube channel to learn ReduX, Redux Saga, Toolkit:
